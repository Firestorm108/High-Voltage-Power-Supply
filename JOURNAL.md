This is my journal of the design and building process of **High Voltage Power Supply**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/17).


## 10/1/2025 - Picked some parts  

Found a good high frequency NST that should work well for this project. Also found some surprisingly cheap capacitors but had to go with slower microwave diodes due to the current output of the NST. I also found a good HV meter and current meter for the power supply. ![Screenshot 2025-09-30 212257.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--03adf19aa85471e2b0c97838b2031c4353bfc420/Screenshot%202025-09-30%20212257.png)
  

## 10/3/2025 12 AM - Designed a flyback transformer  

I looked at high frequency NSTs, flyback modules run from a regular MOSFET based driver, and even laser power supplies! However, nothing fit my needs. A high frequency NST was too expensive and outputted too much current. Standard small flyback modules were too weak and die quickly. I decided the best option was to wind and design my own flyback transformer. I had to perform some calculations and popped open my electronics book since induction is scary but I figured it out. I think it'll be pretty cool. Also decided that parafin wax is the best insulator since I don't have a vacuum chamber for resin and i HATE oil. ![Screenshot 2025-10-02 174216.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c9cbeee6adcd015d52afd89f6bc3704aa1fca86f/Screenshot%202025-10-02%20174216.png)
  

## 10/3/2025 1 AM - Created schematic (started pcb design)  

![CleanShot 2025-10-02 at 18.48.39@2x.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ae322957a9ca731a68130513ec67999b7c3f6dcb/CleanShot%202025-10-02%20at%2018.48.39%402x.png)
I created the schematic for the 13-stage multiplier. It should output 260,000 volts but due to losses, corona discharge, and insulation problems I'd estimate between 200kV and 250kV. I'm going to try to keep it compact so I can fit it in the power supply but that might mean I need to make awkward shapes for the PCB.![CleanShot 2025-10-02 at 18.48.45@2x.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMyLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--bf58c8bec4c0d2cef286c2d58b24042fd497990c/CleanShot%202025-10-02%20at%2018.48.45%402x.png)
  

## 10/4/2025 1 AM - Routed the PCB  

Routed the PCB, decided to only make it 4 stages per PCB. I'm going to just put 3 of these together to get 12 stages and still achieve the same output voltage. Otherwise the PCB would probably be around 400mm long which would not be good. It also saves space in the enclosure by putting them sideways together. Also made sure to minimize corona discharge and leakage with 45 degree angles and spacing. Hopefully parafin wax should be enough to insulate the pins from arcing.

## 10/4/2025 7 PM - Finished the CAD  

Put in all the components, added mounting holes/screws n stuff. I think it turned out pretty well, and it looks like a piece of lab equipment which is kinda cool as well. Luckily I can place the components close together because I'll be putting in 1 pound of insulation inside of it otherwise the power supply would be absolutely huge. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzczLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--57d1b0dfd17bd112f9f247e0b0edc142aca1090d/image.png)
  

## 10/4/2025 8 PM - Did a render and some polishing, added files  

![3f9d282f-023f-48bd-ba73-684587c5a4c4.PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDEyLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--039fc9fae911b25c4b7d8f96ed7f55717eed23a7/3f9d282f-023f-48bd-ba73-684587c5a4c4.PNG)

Uploaded all files to github, did a render, and polished it overall. It's ready to ship now and this should be the final journal entry. I do think the flyback will take a couple rewindings to get right but otherwise the build process should go smoothly. Custom wound transformers usually arc to themselves and require some tuning so that'll probably take the longest about of time.
