# High-Voltage-Power-Supply
A power supply that outputs around 250,000 volts! Utilizes a 16 stage voltage multiplier + custom wound flyback transformer as the input.
I decided to make it a 'lab-style' power supply, so I can use it for testing in vacuums and different types of gases. There's an integrated kilovolt and microampere 
meter so that it can be easily classified. I also decided to integrate the 20A 24V power supply it runs off of so I can hook it up directly to mains and save some wiring space.
Parafin wax + completely rounded pins and edges will be used to minimize leakage and corona discharge.
